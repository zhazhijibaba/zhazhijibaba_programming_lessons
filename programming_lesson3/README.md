#### Weaire-Phelan Structure
The building of Water Cube in Beijing is made of the Weaire-Phelan structure, which is made up of wonky dodecahedrons with pentagonal faces
and tetradecahedrons with 2 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces (bottom right).  
To make the bubble blocks, run  
```
make_bubbles_mesh.py
```
The resuling structure model and 3D prints is showed below:
